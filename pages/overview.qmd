The original framework of dimensions, indices, and indicators representing food system sustainability was developed through a transdisciplinary team science process described in detail by @wiltshire2024RegionalFoodSystema. The figure below shows the structure of this collaborative process.

As the project progressed, a collection of new indicators were proposed across all dimensions, yielding a total of 135 indicators. This full set of indicators is shown in @sec-framework_overview. Starting in July of 2024, the FSRC has been using a collaborative and transparent process to reduce the number of indicators to manageable amount that can comprehensively represent the food system while being tractable enough to be interpretable and actionable. 

More information about this refinement process can be found in the [Indicator Refinement](../pages/refinement_process.qmd) pages, including results from surveys on indicator and index importance. Subsequent analyses in the [Refined Framework Analysis](../pages/refined_framework.qmd) use this reduce set of indicators. The selection of metrics to represent those indicators is tentative. For now, we are using a larger set of metrics than might be otherwise ideal to give us flexibility to explore which best represent the system and what the consequences are given different numbers and configurations of metrics.

## Framework Overview {#sec-framework_overview}

Below is a diagram of all 135 indicators in the framework as of July, 2024. Colors represent dimensions, and splits occur at the dimension and index level. See the table in @sec-framework_table for a more detailed look at indicators.

## Load packages

)


## Load data and add an origin level
dat <- readRDS('data/trees/tree_dat.rds') %>% 
  mutate(Framework = 'Sustainability') %>% 
  select(Framework, Dimension:Indicator)


## Make edges
# include groupings by dimension, then combine them
edges <- list()

## Make vertices
# Each line is a single vertex (dimension, index, or indicator)
# We are just giving them random values to control point size for now
vertices = data.frame(
  name = unique(c(as.character(edges$from), as.character(edges$to))) ,

# Flip label angles around 180 degrees if they are facing the wrong way
