## First Header

Reference something in the @sec-second. Also reference the @sec-references. Note that to use a citation style (csl), we have first have to download the style from [Citation Styles](https://citationstyles.org/) or [Zotero](https://zotero.org/styles) and put the file into the working directory.

## R Chunk

Let's test out how an R chunk goes.

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: "Temperature and ozone level."
#| warning: false
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```


## Second Header {#sec-second}


Note that the engine will automatically be knitr (R) if there are ONLY R chunks in the doc. If there are both python and R chunks, it will use reticulate. In this case, you must NOT set the engine in the YAML header. Just leave it blank, and you can run both R and python together.


## Text {#sec-text}
