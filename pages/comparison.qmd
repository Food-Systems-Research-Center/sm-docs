In the last page we created six sets of scores by state based on combinations of three normalization methods (z-scores, min max, box cox) and two aggregation methods (arithmetic, geometric). Here, we will explore differences between them in terms of state distributions and rankings.

To do:

-   Distributions of values for each method
-   Distributions of rankings for each method
-   Aggregate six New England states into a system-level set for each method and explore values.
-   Sensitivity analysis - what happens when indicators are removed? What happens when states are removed?
