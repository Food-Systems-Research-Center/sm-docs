Metrics and analyses for the Frontiers special issue are works in progress. 
:::

This group of pages will show analyses for the submission to Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems special issue: [Measuring Sustainability in Food Systems](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/68197/measuring-sustainability-in-food-systems-advancing-scientific-indicator-and-metric-systems-for-monitoring-progress-towards-the-un-sustainable-development-goals). I am branching it off from the main "Analyses" pages because they work with state-level data, while this will focus on counties. I am going to leave all that work there for now, though.
