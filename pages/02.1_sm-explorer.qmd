::: {.callout-note collapse='false' title='Caution'}
The SM-Explorer is a work in progress. There are a small heap of bugs I'm already aware of, and it is using a dataset that outdated compared to the Quarto doc. If you find anything else that isn't working properly, feel free to let Chris know about it.
:::

This is a Shiny app that allows for interactive exploration of metrics, mostly at the county level. It includes a map page, a bivariate plot explorer, and a metadata table much like what is included in this Quarto doc. Tt tends to work best if you open it in its own page using the button below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(
    shiny,
    htmltools
)

tagList(
    tags$div(
        style = "display: flex; gap: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px; justify-content: center;",

        tags$a(
            href = "https://chris-donovan.shinyapps.io/SMexplorer/", 
            tags$button(
                "Go To SM-Explorer",
                class = 'btn btn-primary'
            )
        )
    )
)
```

You can also just use it here in the window. Note that some functions (like the full screen button) won't work here.
