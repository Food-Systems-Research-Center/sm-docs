# Sustainability Metrics Docs

## About

> [!NOTE]
> This project is early in development. The framework, metrics, and analyses are all preliminary.
 
The Sustainability Metrics project is a collaborative effort to measure food system sustainability in New England led by the University of Vermont (UVM) UVM Food Systems Research Center (FSRC). We work with five teams of investigators conducting primary research in vital aspects of local and regional food systems. To support this work, we are also exploring secondary data sources. 

This repository houses a Quarto project which describes the framework and contains information on the metrics as well as preliminary exploratory analyses. You can visit the [Quarto website here](https://fsrc.w3.uvm.edu/sustainability_metrics/pages/index.html).
