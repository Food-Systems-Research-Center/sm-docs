<p>Using the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click headers to sort</li>
<li>Rearrange column widths at your leisure</li>
<li>Global search at top right, column search in headers</li>
<li>Change page length and page through results at the bottom</li>
</ul>
<p>To do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn URLs into actual links, get rid of super long links that mess up the table</li>
<li>Make space to include a longer definition and proper citations somehow</li>
<li>Maybe put references section at bottom of page with links from table?</li>
