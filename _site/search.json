    "text": "Explore metric distributions before normalization. Use this to inform how we might want to deal with outliers or normalize data at the metric level. For now, we are leaving the metrics as is, taking arithmetic means, and saving all normalization and weighting for the indicator level.\nTransforming our data from long format to wide and making sure everything came through alright.\n\n1 Distributions\nHere we explore univariate distributions of each of our metrics. Highly skewed distributions might be good candidates for Box-Cox transformations or Winsorization. The figure below shows metrics with a skew &gt; 2 in red, while those with a skew &lt; 2 are in blue.\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(\n  ggplot2,\n  purrr,\n  ggpubr,\n  psych,\n  tibble\n)\n\n# Load metrics_df (created in refined_framework page)\nmetrics_df &lt;- readRDS('data/metrics_df.rds')\n\n# Get skews of variables\nskewed &lt;- psych::describe(metrics_df[, -1]) %&gt;% \n  as.data.frame() %&gt;% \n  rownames_to_column('variable_name') %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(variable_name, skew) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(abs(skew) &gt; 2) %&gt;% \n  pull(variable_name)\n\nplots &lt;- map(names(metrics_df)[-1], \\(var){\n  # color based on skewness\n  if (var %in% skewed) {\n    fill &lt;- 'red'\n    color &lt;- 'darkred'\n  } else {\n    fill &lt;- 'lightblue'\n    color &lt;- 'royalblue'\n  }\n  \n  # Make plot for variable\n  metrics_df %&gt;% \n    ggplot(aes(x = !!sym(var))) + \n    geom_density(\n      fill = fill,\n      color = color,\n      alpha = 0.5\n    ) +\n    theme_classic() +\n    theme(plot.margin = unit(c(rep(0.5, 4)), 'cm'))\n}) \n\n# Arrange them in 4 columns\nggarrange(\n  plotlist = plots,\n  ncol = 4,\n  nrow = 33\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributions of metrics at the state level.\n\n\n\n\nIt seems most of our metrics fall along respectable somewhat-normal distributions. 32 metrics are skewed out of 129 total. They include several variables related to local farm economies (agrotourism sales as a percentage of total sales, direct to consumer sales as a percentage of total sales, and value added sales as a percentage of total sales), as well as a couple of the TreeMap 2016 variables (dead standing carbon and live trees) and GHG emissions from agriculture (CH4 and CO2, with an honorable mention for N2O). Just about the whole collection of ERS metrics are skewed, including importts and exports, indemnities, and real estate expenses.\nThere might be a case for transformations here, or it might make more sense to do it at the indicator level. Another option is to weight our metrics to take into account population, number of farms, acres of farmland, GDP, or some other appropriate variable for each metric. Béné et al. (2019) used Box Cox transformations for highly skewed indicators before normalizing all indicators with Min Max transformations.\nPutting a pin in this to consider trying it with raw metrics and transformed metrics and then to compare the two.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nBéné, Christophe, Steven D.

This provides some opportunities to use data-driven analyses like PCA, but it is worth noting that these will not get us to the holistic, system-wide measurements of sustainability we are after without including some normative judgments as to how to combine geographic areas as well as our five dimensions. So, let’s just go through the motions here, see how the process unfolds, and note anything worth digging into more down the road."

Note that extracting four or more components here gives us a component with less than 0.10, so this is why we are sticking to three. The first component (RC1) explains 38% of the variance in the data. The second component is respectable at 0.26, while the third is barely above the threshold at 0.11.\nLooking at the metrics, we can see that the first component loads mostly onto the conservation practices, no-till acres, cover cropping, drainage, and total fertilizer expenses. The second component leads onto mean above-ground biomass (although there is cross-loading with the first component), operations with silvapasture, operations with easements, rotational grazing operations, and operations with fertilizer expenses. This seems to be catching more of the population-related metrics. The last component only loads onto a few metrics: easement acres, easement acres per farm, and silvapasture operations (which has some heavy cross-loading)."

It will be worth noting this and coming back to explore the differences at some point.\nFor now, let’s keep following Nicoletti and aggregate the component scores into a single variable.\n\n\nCode\nsum_sq_loadings &lt;- map_dbl(sq_loadings, ~ sum(.x))\n(factor_weights &lt;- map_dbl(sum_sq_loadings, ~ .x / (sum(sum_sq_loadings))))\n\n\nCurious that the component that accounted for the most variance is weighted the lowest.

Select the data to display with the layer button on the left.\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(\n  mapview,\n  leaflet,\n  leafpop\n)\nmap_dat &lt;- readRDS('data/sm_spatial.rds')[['ne_counties_2021']] %&gt;%\n  right_join(dimension_scores) %&gt;%\n  left_join(fips_key) %&gt;%\n  select(\n    fips,\n    RC1:RC3,\n    'Dimension Score' = dimension_score,\n    County = county_name,\n    State = state_name,\n    geometry\n  )\n\nmap_dat %&gt;%\n  mapview(\n    zcol = c(\n      'Dimension Score',\n      'RC1',\n      'RC2',\n      'RC3'\n    ),\n    burst = FALSE,\n    hide = c(FALSE, rep(TRUE, 3)),\n    popup = popupTable(\n      map_dat,\n      zcol = names(map_dat)[-length(map_dat)],\n      row.numbers = FALSE,\n      feature.id = FALSE\n  )\n)\n\n\nKeep in mind there are lots of caveats with this very preliminary analysis, the most egregious being a set of metrics that does not well represent the dimension it purports to measure. Missing data and various branching paths of decisions in the index scoring also deserve further scrutiny.\nStill, there is plenty to look at here as a first pass at aggregating dimension scores. The first component, RC1, was heavily influenced by the geography - it loads the strongest onto metrics measuring acres or acres per farm. I presume this is why Aroostook county shows up so high on this scale. RC2 loaded strongly onto the number of operations using various conservation practices (easements, no-till, rotational grazing). It seems to track a little bit with county size, but is highest near relatively urban areas. RC3 was most associated with conservation easement acres and easement acres per farm, and consequently seems to track with rural areas.\nI don’t think that the dimension score inspires much confidence as it is now. The weighting method for combining components is hard to interpret intuitively, and I think more expert driven normative decisions might make more sense at that point. On the bright side, it is a good expedition into the kinds of ambiguous decisions that will need to be made to aggregate this data across the whole system."

    "text": "4 PCA\nPCA is a popular tool in this area for exploring unique variation with many collinear variables. It is a way to reduce the dimensionality of the data into fewer, more interpretable principal components.\nIt also requires complete data, which we do not have. So we either have to run a probabililistic PCA or run imputations. I’m using a random forest algorithm to impute data here as a first pass (Stekhoven and Bühlmann 2012). This really warrants a deeper dive into the type and severity of missingness though, and PPCA is likely the better option in the end.\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(\n  missForest\n)\n\n# Wrangle dataset. Need all numeric vars or factor vars. And can't be tibble\n# Also removing character vars - can't use these in PCA\ndat &lt;- econ_metrics_latest %&gt;%\n  select(where(is.numeric)) %&gt;%\n  as.data.frame()\n# get_str(dat)\n\n# Check missing variables\n# skimr::skim(dat)\n\n# Impute missing variables\nset.seed(42)\nmf_out &lt;- dat %&gt;%\n  missForest(\n    ntree = 200,\n    mtry = 10,\n    verbose = FALSE,\n    variablewise = FALSE\n  )\n\n# Save imputed dataset\nimp &lt;- mf_out$ximp\n\n# Print OOB\nmf_out$OOBerror\n\n\nOut of bag error is shown as normalized root mean square error. Now we can explore how many composite factors is appropriate for the data.\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(\n  psych\n)\nVSS(imp)\nfa.parallel(imp)\n\n\nVSS gives a wide range from 2 to 8, MAP shows 7, parallel analysis shows 4. I tend to trust PA the most, so let’s go with 4.\n\n\nCode\n(pca_out &lt;- pca(imp, nfactors = 4))\n\nplot(pca_out$values)\nabline(h = 1)\n\n\nFrom the scree plot and eigenvalues it looks like the first three components bear lots of unique variance, but after that there is no clear elbow where a qualitative decision can be made to choose a certain number of components. The Kaiser-Guttman rule suggests keeping any compents with an eigenvalue &gt; 1 (at the horizontal line), but we can see here that this is a rather dubious distinction.\nIf we look at the output from the PCA call, we can see how closely each variable (row) correlates with each component (columns 1-4). The variables most associated with Component #1 are the farm labor variables - numbers of workers, labor expenses, etc. They also tend to be raw figures, and probably have more to do with population than anything else. Component #2 is made up mostly of generic employment figures - total civilian labor force, total employed, total unemployed. These are not specific to food systems. Component #3 has a curious collection of median earnings variables and ‘per farm’ variables like acres per farm, income per farm, and local and direct-to-consumer sales. Component #4 does not represent much unique variance, and loooks like a grab bag of variables.\nA couple of early takeaways here are that the raw figures that are tied to population probably shouldn’t be mixed with other variables like proportions. We could try normalizing all the variables so that raw variables are not disproportionately weighted. But it might make more sense to avoid raw counts and dollar amounts entirely."

Orange indicates that the indicator is only being used in the current studies, purple that it is only included in the Wiltshire framework, and green that the indicator is used in both the framework and current studies.\nThe x-axis shows the number of secondary data metrics that have been collected to represent those indicators. You can see that there are some indicators for which there exist many data, but many indicators for which I have found little to represent them.\nValue-added market indicators are pulled from various NASS, as are the total quantity of food and forest products and production inputs. There is plenty more that might be pulled from NASS here. Imports and exports are from the Economic Research Service. The exports data are far more detailed than the imports. The former are disaggregated by category at the state level (fresh fruit, processed fruit, dairy…) which is why there are a heap of metrics for it. The import data is weak - I could only find the value of the top five agricultural imports for each state, not a total. Recalls are from FDA records, but I have not any helpful information the impact of recalls in terms of food safety. Crop diversity is represented in the richness indicator by the Cropland CROS data set, which provides estimates of the area of farmland devoted to specific crops across the US. I have disaggregated these at the county and state levels here.\nYou can see there is plenty more in the frameworks that are not represented by secondary data here, particularly related to the consumer side - marketability, nutrition, food waste, and safety.

If it is within reason, use missForest algorithm to impute missing data (Stekhoven and Bühlmann 2012). This is particularly good at handling MAR data, and does a decent job at handling MNAR data and non-linear relationships as well. If less than 5% of data are missing, just about any method for handling it is reasonable, even listwise deletion (Beaujean 2013).\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(\n  missForest,\n  tibble,\n  dplyr\n)\n\nmetrics_df &lt;- readRDS('data/metrics_df.rds')\nget_str(metrics_df)\n\n# Check for missing data\nskimr::skim(metrics_df)\nmis_dat &lt;- sum(is.na(metrics_df))/(nrow(metrics_df)*(ncol(metrics_df) - 1)) * 100 \nmis_dat &lt;- round(mis_dat, 3)\n\n# Change fips from column to rowname so we can impute without losing it\nmetrics_df &lt;- metrics_df %&gt;% \n  column_to_rownames('fips')\nget_str(metrics_df)\n\n# Impute missing variables\nset.seed(42)\nmf_out &lt;- metrics_df %&gt;%\n  missForest(\n    ntree = 200,\n    mtry = 10,\n    verbose = FALSE,\n    variablewise = FALSE\n  )\n# get_str(mf_out)\n\n# Extract OOB error\n(oob &lt;- mf_out$OOBerror)\n\n# Check missing again\nskimr::skim(mf_out$ximp)\n# Looks good\n\n# Save just imputed data\nimp_dat &lt;- mf_out$ximp\n\n\nWe had 1.474% missing data, which is rather little, and gives us flexibility in handling it. The Out-of-Bag (OOB) error, quantified by the normalized residual mean squared error (NRMSE) the missForest imputation algorithm was 0.415.\n\n\n3 Normalization\nWe are normalizing our data using three methods: min-max, Box-Cox, and Z-scores. (We might also consider Winsorizing at some point.) Results will be saved to a list of three normalized datasets so we can compare outcomes of each one and see what the consequences are.\nMin Max (OECD 2008)\nMin-maxing scales all the data from 0 to 1 by subtracting the minimum value of each variable from all cases and dividing by the range of all cases in the variable. It is rather intuitive, as 1 is the best score, and 0 is the worst. This is a linear transformation, so the relationships between the values should not change.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nI^t_qc = \\frac{x^t_qc - min_c(x^{t_0}_q)}{max_c(x^{t_0}_q)-min_c(x^{t_0}_q)}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(x^t_qc\\) is the metric \\(q\\) for state \\(c\\) at time \\(t\\).\nZ-Scores (OECD 2008)\nZ-scores are stardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Larger numbers are better, but there are no caps on the highest or lowest values. A value of 2 would mean that it is 2 standard deviations greater than the mean. Again, this is a linear transformation, so relationships between variables should not change.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nI^t_{qc} = \\frac{x^t_{qc}-x^t_{qc=\\overline{c}}}{\\sigma^t_{qc=\\overline{c}}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(x^t_qc\\) is the metric \\(q\\) for state \\(c\\) at time \\(t\\).\nBox Cox (Bickel and Doksum 1981)\nBox-Cox transformations are non-linear transformations that use an optimal value of lambda to make the distribution as normal as possible. This has some strengths in that the data are easier to work with in further analyses. It also effectively pulls outliers inward toward the center of the distribution. However, it also changes relationships between the variables, so it will distort any bivariate correlations.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n{\\rm For}\\ \\lambda\\neq0,\\ f\\lambda(x) = (sign(x)|x|^\\lambda-1)/\\lambda\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n{\\rm For}\\ \\lambda = 0,\\ f_0(x) = log(x)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(\n  forecast,\n  DescTools,\n  purrr\n)\n\n# List of results\nnormed &lt;- list()\nget_str(imp_dat)\n\n# Z scores\nnormed$zscore &lt;- imp_dat %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric(scale(.x, scale = TRUE, center = TRUE))))\n\n# Min Max\nmin_max &lt;- function(x) {\n  (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))\n}\nnormed$minmax &lt;- imp_dat %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(everything(), min_max))\n\n# Box Cox.

Either more of it is better, or less of it is better. This is rather problematic in that just about any metric becomes negative with too much or too little of it. What might make more sense in the long run would be to consult the expertise of our teams and develop targets or acceptable ranges for some metrics once they are settled. Still, just about every sustainability indicator framework does some variation of this one-way value system (Schneider et al. 2023; Béné et al. 2019; Nicoletti 2000; Jacobi et al. 2020; Gómez-Limón and Sanchez-Fernandez 2010).\nAlas, for now we will invert variables in each of the transformed datasets as necessary so that larger numbers are more sustainable, and smaller numbers are less sustainable. The table below shows this assignment in the desired_direction column. For couple of variables (vacancy rate and animal sales as a percentage of all agricultural sales) I was not comfortable assigning one direction as better than the other, so I have removed them from the refined framework.\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(\n  reactable,\n  purrr\n)\nsource('dev/get_reactable.R')\n\n# map(normed, get_str)\n# (names &lt;- names(normed[[1]]))\n\n# Higher numbers should be better.

Arithmetic means are fully compensable, in that a strong score in one area can make up for a weak score in another. Geometric means are only somewhat compensable - it effectively applies a penalty for unbalanced scores.\nWe might also consider PCA here, as we have done with the preliminary dimension metrics previously. But the n:p ratio is not in our favor for PCA as we have more metrics than states. Will revisit this, perhaps by splitting it up into dimensions again rather than trying the whole framework at once, or possible using a sparse PCA procedure that incorporates variable selection.\nWe will end up with 10 iterations of our data (5 normalization methods * 2 aggregation methods).\nIndicator Means:\n\n\nCode\n# We need to attach these back to framework from metadata\n# Filter frame from earlier down to our current metrics\nframe &lt;- readRDS('data/frame.rds')\nfiltered_frame &lt;- frame %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(variable_name %in% names(normed[[1]])) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(variable_name, indicator, index, dimension)\nget_str(filtered_frame)\n\n# Save this for later - use in regression and variable selection \nsaveRDS(filtered_frame, 'data/filtered_frame.rds')\n\n# Make a list where we hold scores for indicators, indices, and dimensions\nscores &lt;- list()\n\n# Function for geometric mean\ngeometric_mean = function(x, na.rm = TRUE){\n  exp(sum(log(x[x &gt; 0]), na.rm = na.rm) / length(x))\n}\n\n# Get indicator scores across all three normalization methods\nindicator_scores &lt;- map(normed, \\(df) {\n  \n  # For each df, calculate indicator means\n  indicators_out &lt;- map(unique(filtered_frame$indicator), \\(ind) {\n  \n    # Column name based on indicator\n    ind_snake &lt;- ind\n    \n    # Split into groups by indicator, with one or more metrics each\n    variables &lt;- filtered_frame %&gt;% \n      dplyr::filter(indicator == ind) %&gt;% \n      pull(variable_name) %&gt;% \n      unique()\n    indicator_metrics &lt;- df %&gt;% \n      select(all_of(variables))\n    \n    # Get arithmetic and geo means for each indicator\n    dfs &lt;- list()\n    dfs$arithmetic &lt;- indicator_metrics %&gt;%\n      rowwise() %&gt;%\n      mutate(\n        !!sym(ind_snake) := mean(c_across(everything())),\n      ) %&gt;%\n      select(!!sym(ind_snake))\n    dfs$geometric &lt;- indicator_metrics %&gt;% \n      rowwise() %&gt;% \n      mutate(\n        !!sym(ind_snake) := geometric_mean(c_across(everything())),\n      ) %&gt;%\n      select(!!sym(ind_snake))\n    return(dfs) \n  })\n  \n  # Rearrange so we put each aggregation method (arith, geo) together\n  norm_out &lt;- list()\n  norm_out$arithmetic &lt;- map(indicators_out, ~ {\n    .x[grep(\"arithmetic\", names(.x))]\n  }) %&gt;% \n    bind_cols()\n  norm_out$geometric &lt;- map(indicators_out, ~ {\n    .x[grep(\"geometric\", names(.x))]\n  }) %&gt;% \n    bind_cols()\n  return(norm_out) \n})\n  \nget_str(indicator_scores, 3)\nget_str(indicator_scores, 4)\n\n\nIndex Means:\n\n\nCode\n# For each set of indicator scores, calculate index scores\n# get_str(indicator_scores, 4)\nindices &lt;- unique(filtered_frame$index)\n\n# Choose aggregation function based on agg_type\nagg_function &lt;- function(x, agg_type) {\n   if (agg_type == 'geometric') {\n    geometric_mean(x)\n  } else if (agg_type == 'arithmetic') {\n    mean(x)\n  }\n}\n\nindex_scores &lt;- map(indicator_scores, \\(norm_type) {\n  imap(norm_type, \\(agg_df, agg_type) {\n    map(indices, \\(index_) {\n      # Get names of indicators for this index\n      index_indicators &lt;- filtered_frame %&gt;% \n        filter(index == index_) %&gt;% \n        pull(indicator) %&gt;% \n        unique()\n      # Get DF of indicators for this index\n      index_indicator_df &lt;- agg_df %&gt;% \n        select(all_of(index_indicators))\n      # Get arithmetic or geometric mean, based on agg_type\n      index_indicator_df %&gt;% \n        rowwise() %&gt;% \n        # mutate(mean = across(everything(), agg_function(agg_type)))\n        mutate(!!sym(index_) := agg_function(c_across(everything()), agg_type)) %&gt;% \n        select(!!sym(index_))\n    }) %&gt;% \n      bind_cols()\n  })\n})\nget_str(index_scores, 4)\n\n\nDimension Means:\n\n\nCode\nget_str(index_scores, 4)\n\n# Same process for dimensions\ndimensions &lt;- unique(filtered_frame$dimension)\n\ndimension_scores &lt;- map(index_scores, \\(norm_type) {\n  imap(norm_type, \\(agg_df, agg_type) {\n    map(dimensions, \\(dimension_) {\n      # Get names of indices for this dimension\n      dimension_indices &lt;- filtered_frame %&gt;% \n        filter(dimension == dimension_) %&gt;% \n        pull(index) %&gt;% \n        unique()\n      # Get DF of indice for this dimension\n      dimension_index_df &lt;- agg_df %&gt;% \n        select(all_of(dimension_indices))\n      # Get arithmetic or geometric mean, based on agg_type\n      dimension_index_df %&gt;% \n        rowwise() %&gt;% \n        mutate(!!sym(dimension_) := agg_function(\n          c_across(everything()), \n          agg_type\n        )) %&gt;% \n        select(!!sym(dimension_))\n    }) %&gt;% \n      bind_cols()\n  })\n})\nget_str(dimension_scores, 4)\n\n\n\n\n6 Wrangle\nHere, we organize arithmetic and geometric means for each level of the framework (indicator, index, dimension) in a way that is easier to work with.

    "text": "This page shows the partially refined framework as it stands after three dimension meetings: economics, environment, and production. It also includes a selection of preliminary secondary data metrics to match those indicators. We have collected around 1500 metrics so far, although many of those are fluff. Effectively, we have around 600 meaningful metrics. Here, we are using a selection of ~129 of them to make a preliminary framework for preliminary analyses. This is more than we have been planning for the refined framework, which will give us a chance to see how aggregate scores change with different combinations of metrics and under different methods of aggregation.\nNote that where I have no metrics to represent an indicator, I have added placeholders of the format NONE_#. This does not mean that secondary data do not exist, just that I either haven’t found it or haven’t cleaned and wrangled it yet. At the time of writing, there are several of the latter, including crop failure, access to care, racial diversity, and others. If you know of any secondary data to fill in the gaps or improve on data we already have, please do reach out to let Chris know about it.\nAt the bottom of this page is a metadata table with sources and definitions for all the metrics.",

I do have biodiversity and sensitive habitat data, but still need to process it at the state level and add it to the collection. Some weak points are the carbon stocks indicator - so far, this is all from the TreeMap 2016 dataset. I would love to include other stocks of carbon if anyone has leads on datasets. The metrics for embodied carbon are also stretches.\nOne gap I’ve noticed since this dimension was reworked in the dimension meeting is that there is no direct treatment of soil health included anymore. We might add soil metrics for carbon stocks or forest health, but there is no clear home for it. And that being said, I have had no luck finding any reliable soil health datasets, so I’m all ears here too.\n\n\nCode\nsource('dev/get_dimension_ggraph.R')\nget_dimension_ggraph(\n  framework_df = frame,\n  dimension_in = 'environment',\n  include_metrics = TRUE,\n  y_limits = c(-2, 3.25),\n  palette = \"ggthemes::stata_s2color\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Economics\nIt has definitely been easier to find economics data than other dimensions. Worth noting here is that the access to land indicator is not ideal. I’m using value and farm size as a proxy for access. Use of crop insurance is also a proxy, since I could not find direct insurance claim data from FSA. So for now, we are just using the ag secretary declarations of disasters that allow for insurance claims as a proxy.\n\n\nCode\nget_dimension_ggraph(\n  framework_df = frame,\n  dimension_in = 'economics',\n  include_metrics = TRUE,\n  y_limits = c(-1.5, 3.1),\n  palette = \"ggthemes::stata_s2color\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Production\nAgricultural exports are a pretty robust dataset at the state level from ERS, although the import data only includes the values of the top five imports for each state - not ideal. Crop diversity is based on the Cropland Data Layer, a USDA NASS spatial model estimating of crop types, which I used to calculate Shannon diversity at the county and state level. The rest of the metrics come from NASS. Production is an area in which I feel better about using NASS data than some other dimensions, but there is still some risk of these data not representing VT farms appropriately.\n\n\nCode\nget_dimension_ggraph(\n  framework_df = frame,\n  dimension_in = 'production',\n  include_metrics = TRUE,\n  y_limits = c(-1.75, 3),\n  palette = \"ggthemes::stata_s2color\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Health\nThe Food Environment Atlas has lots of data on access and nutrition, which accounts for much of the food security data, along with NASS. I threw in a slew of metrics for physical health under the temporary indicator name ‘physical health tbd’ just to differentiate it from the index. I also have a handful of established composite indices for health, including the UW County Health Rankings metrics for health factors (behavior, clinical care, social and economic factors, physical environment) and health outcomes (length of life, quality of life), as well as some established food security indices that are not included in this framework. I will instead use them to compare to dimensions scores as external validation in the Validation section.\n\n\nCode\nget_dimension_ggraph(\n  framework_df = frame,\n  dimension_in = 'health',\n  include_metrics = TRUE,\n  y_limits = c(-1.7, 3),\n  palette = \"ggthemes::stata_s2color\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5 Social\nThe social dimension is admittedly slim, but it could have been a lot worse. The County Health Rankings dataset brings a few useful metrics here, like social associations and disconnected youth. Census participation and voter turnout are proxies for participatory governance in food systems - I can’t imagine finding something much more specific than that at this point. I also plan on replacing mean producer age with a diversity index for age structure among producers.\n\n\nCode\nget_dimension_ggraph(\n  framework_df = frame,\n  dimension_in = 'social',\n  include_metrics = TRUE,\n  y_limits = c(-1.7, 3),\n  palette = \"ggthemes::stata_s2color\"\n)",

They include several variables related to local farm economies (agrotourism sales as a percentage of total sales, direct to consumer sales as a percentage of total sales, and value added sales as a percentage of total sales), as well as a couple of the TreeMap 2016 variables (dead standing carbon and live trees) and GHG emissions from agriculture (CH4 and CO2, with an honorable mention for N2O). Just about the whole collection of ERS metrics are skewed, including importts and exports, indemnities, and real estate expenses.\nThere might be a case for transformations here, or it might make more sense to do it at the indicator level. Another option is to weight our metrics to take into account population, number of farms, acres of farmland, GDP, or some other appropriate variable for each metric. Béné et al. (2019) used Box Cox transformations for highly skewed indicators before normalizing all indicators with Min Max transformations.\nPutting a pin in this to consider trying it with raw metrics and transformed metrics and then to compare the two.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nBéné, Christophe, Steven D.

Both the min-max and z-score transformations left us with only three skewed indicators: access to culturally appropriate food, total quantity exported, and total quantity imported. The latter two are not surprising, as big agricultural states likely have a disproportionate impact. The Z-score with geometric aggregation is a slightly nonsensical combination of methods that we will ignore for now.\nThis is providing some evidence that Box-Cox transformations could be warranted on at least these three problematic indicators (or the metrics therein). Below are the indicator distributions for each transformation.

    "text": "In the last page we created six sets of scores by state based on combinations of three normalization methods (z-scores, min max, box cox) and two aggregation methods (arithmetic, geometric). Here, we will explore differences between them in terms of state distributions and rankings.\nNote that each set of spider plots are scaled to the minimum and maximum of any single state in that dimension, given the normalization and aggregation methods. This means in the case of min-max normalization, for example, raw metrics are scaled from 0 to 1, arithmetic and geometric means consolidate values to dimension scores, and these sets of dimension scores are scaled on the plot from the lowest to the highest value of any state. A “perfect” score here means that it is the best of any state. Plots show dimension values for Vermont in green. The dotted purple polygon behind it is the median of US states and DC. Arithmetic means are on the left, and geometric on the right.\nBe aware that spider/radar charts can be hard to interpret, and sometimes misleading The Radar Chart and its Caveats. The order of variables makes a big impact on the area of chart, and area is not a terribly reliable way to show differences, as it increases quadratically as variables increase linearly. Will explore some other ways to show this information, but using these for now as they are quite popular in the literature for sustainability metrics.",
