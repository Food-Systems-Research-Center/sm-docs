    "text": "Introduction\nFood systems are increasingly recognized as an essential piece of sustainable development (Nations 2015). Approximately 42% of world’s population depend on agriculture for employment, which is increasingly challenging in the face of farm consolidationm, changing consumption patterns, and climate change (Giller et al. 2021; Aznar-Sánchez et al. 2019). Food systems themselves are responsible for one-third of greenhouse gas emissions, while anthropogenic climate change has reduced agricultural output by 21% in the last 60 years (Crippa et al. 2021; Ortiz-Bobea et al. 2021). [Add line about hunger, nutrition, food security.]\nConsequently, the sustainability of food systems is paramount in meeting the needs of the population without exceeding planetary boundaries. However, there is little consensus on how to define, let alone measure food system sustainability (Allen and Prosperi 2016; Béné et al. 2019). And while there is an abundance of research at the global level (Bathaei and Štreimikienė 2023; Chaudhary, Gustafson, and Mathys 2018), there exists a conspicuous gap in understanding at the local, regional, or landscape level (Dale et al. 2012).\nThe Sustainability Metrics project is an effort to develop both the conceptual and methodological frameworks to define and measure regional food system sustainability in New England. The work is led by the Food Systems Research Center at the University of Vermont in partnership with the USDA Agricultural Research Service in Burlington, Vermont. Primary research in developing and measuring indicators of sustainability is ongoing. For now, what you will find here is a growing collection of secondary data, visualizations, and preliminary analyses to help inform the project as well as the public on the sustainability of the New England food system.\nMetadata and citations will be provided throughout the document, but it is worth appreciating the work of the folks at USDA AMS Food and Agriculture Mapper and Explorer in particular, as many of the data shown here were cleaned and compiled in their data warehouse.",
