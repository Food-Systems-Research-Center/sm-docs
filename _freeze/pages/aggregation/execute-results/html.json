Using the OECD handbook on composite indices as a guide [@oecdHandbookConstructingComposite2008].\n\n- Some examples to pull from:\n  - @schneider2023StateFoodSystems\n    - rank order comparisons only\n    - compare to global weighted means by groups based on GDP\n    - min max scaling to show distance from global groups\n  - @bene2019GlobalMapIndicators\n    - Box cox for most skewed indicators (skew > 2) then min max\n    - geometric means for enviro and economic dimensions\n    - arithmetic means for social and food dimensions\n    - geometric mean for combining all four dimensions into one\n  - @nicolettiSummaryIndicatorsProduct2000\n    - Used normalized square loadings (indicator weights) to weight each indicator\n  - @gomez-limon2010EmpiricalEvaluationAgricultural\n    - min max normalization\n    - compared several different methods of aggregation \n      - mostly correlated, no big differences\n      - weighted sum of indicators\n      - product of weighted indicators\n      - muilticriteria function based on distance to ideal point\n    - Weighting - did both PCA and analytic hierarchy process\n    - Validation (identifying important factors) - double censored tobit - index as dependent, indicators as independent\n  - @adamudemelash2024MeasuringFoodSystem\n    - Normalization with distance to reference\n      - reference determined by quartile analysis\n      - not affected by outliers, extreme values\n    - Equal weighting\n    - Linear aggregation\n    - Additive method for indicators within dimensions\n    - Geometric means for aggregate scores across four dimensions\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Imputation\n\nFirst, check how much missing data there are. If it is within reason, use missForest algorithm to impute missing data [@stekhovenMissForestNonparametricMissing2012a]. This is particularly good at handling MAR data, and does a decent job at handling MNAR data and non-linear relationships as well. If less than 5% of data are missing, just about any method for handling it is reasonable, even listwise deletion [@beaujean2013].\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmetrics_df <- readRDS('data/metrics_df.rds')\nget_str(metrics_df)\n\n# Check for missing data\nskimr::skim(metrics_df)\nmis_dat <- sum(is.na(metrics_df))/(nrow(metrics_df)*(ncol(metrics_df) - 1)) * 100 \nmis_dat <- round(mis_dat, 3)\n\n# Change fips from column to rowname so we can impute without losing it\nmetrics_df <- metrics_df %>% \n  column_to_rownames('fips')\nget_str(metrics_df)\n\n# Impute missing variables\nset.seed(42)\nmf_out <- metrics_df %>%\n  missForest(\n    ntree = 200,\n    mtry = 10,\n    verbose = FALSE,\n    variablewise = FALSE\n  )\nget_str(mf_out)\n\n# Extract OOB error\n(oob <- mf_out$OOBerror)\n\n# Check missing again\nskimr::skim(mf_out$ximp)\n# Looks good\n\n# Save just imputed data\nimp_dat <- mf_out$ximp\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe had 0.785% missing data, which is rather little, and gives us flexibility in handling it. The Out-of-Bag (OOB) error, quantified by the normalized residual mean squared error (NRMSE) the missForest imputation algorithm was 0.\n\n# Transformations\n\nTransforming distributions and dealing with outliers. Three options. \n\n**Raw Values**\n\nJust as it sounds - do nothing. More interpretable, but vulnerable to outliers that throw off the distribution of scores. \n\n**Winsorization**\n\nShift extreme values to the 5th and 95th percentiles. Does not reward overperformance in any one area, but is rather heavy-handed in reshaping the distribution and leads to information loss.\n\n**Box Cox** [@bickel1981]\n\nBox-Cox transformations are non-linear transformations that use an optimal value of lambda to make the distribution as normal as possible. This has some strengths in that the data are easier to work with in further analyses. It also effectively pulls outliers inward toward the center of the distribution. However, it also changes relationships between the variables, so it will distort any bivariate correlations.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\rm For}\\ \\lambda\\neq0,\\ f\\lambda(x) = (sign(x)|x|^\\lambda-1)/\\lambda\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\rm For}\\ \\lambda = 0,\\ f_0(x) = log(x)\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# List of results of transformations\ntransformed <- list()\nget_str(imp_dat)\n\n# Raw - just leave it as is\ntransformed$raw <- imp_dat\n\n# Box Cox. If there are negatives, shifting to remove them\ntransformed$boxcox <- imp_dat %>% \n  mutate(across(everything(), ~ {\n    if (any(.x <= 0)) {\n      shift <- abs(min(.x)) + 1\n      vals <- .x + shift\n    } else {\n      vals <- .x\n    }\n    optimal_lambda <- forecast::BoxCox.lambda(vals, method = 'loglik')\n    print(paste0('Optimal lambda: ', optimal_lambda))\n    out <- forecast::BoxCox(vals, lambda = optimal_lambda)\n    return(out)\n  }))\nget_str(transformed$boxcox)    \n\n# Winsorization\ntransformed$winsor <- imp_dat %>% \n  mutate(across(everything(), DescTools::Winsorize))\nget_str(transformed$winsor)\n\n# Check\nmap(transformed, get_str)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Rescaling\n\nWe are rescaling our data using five methods: rank order, min-max, and Z-scores. \n\n**Rank Order** \n\nYields nice clean distributions, but means lots of lost information. used by @schneider2023StateFoodSystems in the Food Systems Countdown to 2030. \n\n**Min Max** [@oecdHandbookConstructingComposite2008]\n\nMin-maxing scales all the data from 0 to 1 by subtracting the minimum value of each variable from all cases and dividing by the range of all cases in the variable. It is rather intuitive, as 1 is the best score, and 0 is the worst. This is a linear transformation, so the relationships between the values should not change.\n\n\\begin{equation}\nI^t_qc = \\frac{x^t_qc - min_c(x^{t_0}_q)}{max_c(x^{t_0}_q)-min_c(x^{t_0}_q)}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWhere $x^t_qc$ is the metric $q$ for state $c$ at time $t$. \n\n**Z-Scores** [@oecdHandbookConstructingComposite2008]\n\nZ-scores are stardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Larger numbers are better, but there are no caps on the highest or lowest values. A value of 2 would mean that it is 2 standard deviations greater than the mean. Again, this is a linear transformation, so relationships between variables should not change.  \n\n\\begin{equation}\nI^t_{qc} = \\frac{x^t_{qc}-x^t_{qc=\\overline{c}}}{\\sigma^t_{qc=\\overline{c}}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWhere $x^t_qc$ is the metric $q$ for state $c$ at time $t$.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_str(imp_dat)\n\n# List of results\nscaled <- list()\n\n# Z-scores, one for each transformation\nscaled$zscore <- map(transformed, \\(trans) {\n  trans %>% \n    mutate(across(\n      everything(),\n      ~ as.numeric(scale(.x, scale = TRUE, center = TRUE))\n    ))\n})\nget_str(scaled$zscore)\n\n# Min Max\nmin_max <- function(x) {\n  (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))\n}\nscaled$minmax <- map(transformed, \\(trans) {\n  trans %>% \n    mutate(across(everything(), min_max))\n})\nget_str(scaled$minmax)  \n\n# Rank order from lowest to highest value for each var. We are coding this such\n# that higher ranks are better. So 51 should have the highest/best value and\n# rank 1 should have the worst.\nscaled$rank <- map(transformed, \\(trans) {\n  map(names(trans), \\(col_name) {\n    trans %>% \n      rownames_to_column('fips') %>% \n      dplyr::select(fips, col_name) %>% \n      mutate(!!sym(col_name) := dense_rank(.data[[col_name]]))\n  }) %>% \n    reduce(full_join) %>% \n    column_to_rownames('fips')\n})\nget_str(scaled$rank)\n\n# Check\nmap(scaled, get_str)\n\n# Unlist these so instead of 3x3 it is 1x9\nscaled <- purrr::list_flatten(scaled, name_spec = \"{inner}_{outer}\")\nnames(scaled)\nget_str(scaled)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Directional Values\n\nHere, we are assuming that each metric has a direction that is more sustainable than the opposite. Either more of it is better, or less of it is better. This is rather problematic in that just about any metric becomes negative with too much or too little of it. What might make more sense in the long run would be to consult the expertise of our teams and develop targets or acceptable ranges for some metrics once they are settled. Still, just about every sustainability indicator framework does some variation of this one-way value system [@schneider2023StateFoodSystems; @bene2019GlobalMapIndicators; @nicolettiSummaryIndicatorsProduct2000; @jacobi2020NewUnderstandingEvaluation; @gomez-limon2010EmpiricalEvaluationAgricultural].\n\nAlas, for now we will invert variables in each of the transformed datasets as necessary so that larger numbers are more sustainable, and smaller numbers are less sustainable. The table below shows this assignment in the `desirable` column. For a handful of variables (vacancy rate, mean farm size, etc.) I was not comfortable assigning one direction as better than the other, so I have removed them from the refined framework.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Check variable names\n(vars <- names(scaled[[1]]))\n\n# Higher numbers should be better.
