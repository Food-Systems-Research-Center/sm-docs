## Introduction {.smaller}

:::: {.columns .v-center-container}

::: {.column width = '40%'}

-   Goals for secondary data:
    -   Identify existing data and gaps
    -   Explore methods of aggregating data
-   Structure of presentation:
    1.  Framework and methods
    2.  Preliminary results of case study
    3.  Uncertainty and sensitivity
-   Guiding questions:
    -   How well do the data represesent the system?
    -   Valuation, scaling, weighting, aggregation
    -   Where and how do we incorporate qualitative data?

-   The point is to take stock of existing data, swap out and fill in with primary research where necessary. 
-   Skeleton of a framework.

# 1. Framework and Methods {.centered-section}

## Conclusions {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width = '50%'}

-   Findings:
    -   Gaps in secondary data
        -   Soil health, carbon stocks, water quantity 
        -   Food distribution, loss, and waste
        -   Diversity of farm types, production diversity
        -   Social dimension
    -   Framework complexity and coherence
    -   Stability and sensitivity
    -   Influential indicators
        -   Carbon fluxes
        -   Various health indicators
        -   Social connectedness
-   Looking ahead:

::: notes

-   Gaps:
    -   NASS stats lean toward commodity crops
    -   Soil health
    -   Food distribution capacity (have some of this)
    -   Food loss and waste
    -   Embodied Carbon
    -   Carbon stocks
    -   forest complexity
    -   water quality
    -   water quantity
    -   precarity, market health indices
    -   diversity of Farm Types (this one tricky for VT)
    -   nutrition\*
    -   all of social dimension\*
-   Complexity and coherence:
    -   Cronbach: Some are coherent (health, and lesser extent economics and environment)
    -   Is this important to us? What does this mean for social dimension?
-   Sensitivity:
    -   Some dimensions stable (health)
    -   Others ambiguous (economics)
    -   Metric counts: fewer means risk of poor fit
    -   Diagnostic for indicator influence (production species diversity)
-   Metric counts: fewer increases risks?
-   Influential indicators:
    -   Carbon fluxes (10 interactions)
    -   Access to care, value added market (6)
    -   Operations diversification, phyiscal health, production quantities (5)
    -   More about GDP? Need to deal with this
    -   Social connectedness (5)
    -   From indicator sensitivity: social connectedness and production diversity
